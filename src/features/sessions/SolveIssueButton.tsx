 * "Solve with agent" action for an issue: hands the issue to a new write-capable
 * agent session to investigate and resolve it. Distinct from a plan's "Implement
 * now" — an issue is a problem to diagnose and fix, not a vetted spec — so it gets
 * a solve/debug framing (see {@link buildSolveIssuePrompt}). It doesn't spend
 * tokens immediately: it seeds the "Delegate a task" composer (the human gate)
 * where the user picks the agent/model/effort and confirms. AI-gated.
