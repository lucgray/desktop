 * Periodic background `git fetch` for the open repo. Quiet (no toasts) — it
 * keeps the behind-count and incoming commits current without the user pressing
 * Fetch. A fetch is read-only on the local side (it only updates
 * remote-tracking refs), so it never touches the working tree or local
 * branches; pulling and pushing stay manual.
 *
 * Cadence: an interval tick that fires only while the window is focused (so we
 * don't poll the network for an app sitting in the background — matching the
 * app's `refetchIntervalInBackground: false` stance), plus a fetch when the
 * window regains focus or a repo opens *and* it's been at least one interval
 * since the last fetch. So returning to GitDesktop, or opening a repo, refreshes
 * right away without burning network while you're away.
 *
 * Every attempt is gated on: enabled + an `origin` remote + `navigator.onLine`
 * + no sync op already in flight (`busy` — fetch/pull/push), so a background
 * fetch never races a user-initiated pull or push on the same remote refs. It
 * shares the caller's fetch mutation, so the existing Fetch-button spinner and
 * busy state cover auto-fetches too.
